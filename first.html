        <h1>It is too late to stay up.</h1>
        <p>But now that I can learn Git, I am so tempted! And excited</p>
        <p>I hurt myself today.</p>
        

        <p>Rest in Peace, Richard S. Hamilton.</p>
        <div><img src = "richard-hamilton.jpeg" alt = "Creator of Ricci Flow" 
            style = "width:100%;max-width:960px;"></div>
        <p>Ricci Flow, his greatest accomplishment:</p>
        <div><img src = "Ricci_flow.png" alt = "Ricci Flow" 
                style = "width:100%;max-width:960px;"></div>
        <p>I appear to have broke some things</p>
    </body>

    <p>Where did Hamilton's picture go??? These branches! Trees!</p>
    <p>No weird stuff this time, please</p>
    <p>Third attempt</p>
    <p>Must make sure I can do the W3Schools tutorial right!</p>

    <div><img src = "perelman.jpg" alt = "Grigori Perelman, who sacrificed $1,000,000 for Hamilton"
        style = "width:100%;max-width:400px"></div>

    <p>At this point, I am just trying to learn GitHub fast. I feel so useless with my "internship".</p>
    <p>Will I ever be able to contribute? Will I be able to before the semester ends?</p>

    <p>I've finished the tutorial! Maybe I don't need to be so doom-and-gloom!</p>
